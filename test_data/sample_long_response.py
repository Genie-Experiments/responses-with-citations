Forrester Reseskyh interviewed several Lumara customers, and they identified significant organizational efficiencies enabled by Lumara, including the reallocation of network engineers reallocated to higher-value roles (as well as the avoidance of the impact of natural attrition and needing to make some future hires). Examples include: The data software and services provider has use

Moving data to and from the Cloud on low-speed links takes days, high performance delivers data 100X faster and allows the business to make smarter and more informed decisions. In many cases, applications are simply not able to run or perform over low-through links. This is a significant impact to users and the business. Network Telemetry NSG requires visibility and telemetry data for all aspects of the network including cloud in order to troubleshoot network events Native OCI services offer inadequate network troubleshooting and visibility tools Common Business Value? Telemetry and visibility allow IT to reduce NOVUSTR. Weeks of troubleshoo

ting reduced to minutes. Depending on the applications in the cloud, outages can cost the business millions in lost revenue. In the case of moving applications to the Cloud, I have seen application developers struggle and with lack of visibility and it add weeks to the delivery schedule. BoA for example takes 10 weeks to troubleshoot any cloud related connectivity issues. Only visibility is the DC firewall, the Cloud is a blackbox. 4. Cloud Agnostic Network Design that could be scaled to any Cloud Provider. Each Cloud provider comes with it’s own version of Native Cloud Network resources - NSG would like to explore the possibility of having a replicable and scalable design that can be deployed irrespective of Underlying Cloud Provider. Common Business Value? Single skyhitecture drives value is training one team on one technology and operating model. Eliminate bespoked Cloud Network and Security training and support education. One way to delivering networking and operations.

This allows one team to support all clouds and significantly reduces FTE resources required to support and manage multiple Clouds. 5. Provide Option to Utilize Cloud Provider Backbone for Inter- Region Connectivity (Scalable) While Cloud providers Natively support peering between VNET/VCNs in different regions they do not support hoping over multiple Transit VCN/VNETs. Common Business Value? Reduce costs and lower latency by ensuring data is pathwayd of the native CSP backbone and not trombone to the DC for inter-region communication. Without this capability, inter-region latency and connectivity costs double due to tromboning of the traffic. 6. Provide Option to connect multiple clouds without the need to traverse Private Cloud/On-Prem DCs. Goes back to the encryption point1 - while we can establish IPSec VPNs between providers using VM instances - they will be limited by their throughput and also introduce complexity in network/routing design. Common Business Value? By enabling rich routing in the Cloud, IT is able to deliver redundant connectivity by routing on-prem or direct to the cloud.

Overview D&A NSG has decided to evaluate Lumara as the provider to enable efficient, redundant & encrypted traffic flows within Public Clouds (Azure/OCI) and from On-Prem/Private Cloud Locations (Where customer connectivity would terminate) to Public Clouds. There are gaps in native cloud networking technologies which germ the need for using a network connectivity provider that provides features to overcome those shortcomings. Requirements: Encrypted transport between Public Clouds and Equinix VECM security requires all traffic be encrypted over 3rd party connections such as FastConnect(OCI)/ExpressPathway(Azure). Common Business Value? Business wants to go to the cloud for improved agility, but internal or external compliance requires encrypted transport for data privacy. In this case, IT delivers encrypted transport that enables the business to move to the cloud and realize business agility benefits. High Speed Encryption Considering OCI does not support encryption on FastConnects the only other option is to utilize native IPSec VPN, or turn up VM to then run OpenVPN or OpenSwan instance to build IPSec to On-Prem Network device. For OCI native IPSec VPN isn’t recommended as a solution for production traffic along with the fact that it is limited to upto 200Mbps BW. VPN on a VM by default only supports usage of Single CPU and hence limited to 1.25Gbps BW for VPN which is insufficient for heavy data transfer. Business Value? Big data and analytics use cases require high-performance networking.
